		},
		{
			"title":"Mobile Presence",
			"img":"cool-website.png",
			"text":"Make sure you don't lose out on your market. Most people can access your site as it is on mobile. The experience should be good. So should you go native with an app, or just use a website."
		},
		{
			"title":"Native or not",
			"img":"native-never.png",
			"text":"There are a lot of strong feelings on the subject. When Java came we got a platform agnostic language: write once, run everywhere. Apps are introducing old restrictions to software. Write for a specific OS, tap into all the OS specific APIs, do more with the app! These arguments run along very technical lines. What does the user need?"
		},
		{
			"title":"Sometimes Native is What You Need",
			"img":"native.png",
			"text":"What if you want to use the mobile device's camera? Scan in labels, upload images? Integrating with the mobile device via an app gives you access to the device's features. Some of these interactions are not possible today with a website. Most likely a lot of them will become available."
		},
		{
			"title":"Sometimes a Website is Better Suited",
			"img":"newssite.png",
			"text":"What about a blog? Or a news site? Or a site that doesn't need to interact with the OS? Do they really need an app? What should visitors see when they come to this type of site? What about your company site?"
		},
		{
			"title":"Yet Another Debate",
			"img":"2sites-2designs.png",
			"text":"So how should I display my website then? Should I have one website that both mobile and desktop users see, or should I have two multiple websites, each tailored to a particular device?"

		{
			"title":"Jakob Nielsen",
			"img":"jakob-nielsen.png",
			"text":"Jakob Nielson is <em>the</em> authority on usable web design. He's written numerous books about web design, and was one of the first to advocate so strongly for user driven design. To oversimplify, Jakob Nielsen suggests that users on mobile devices just don't have the time or the attention span for a lot of data. So give them minimal features and minimal data."

		{
			"title":"Mobile Context Implications",
			"img":"mobile-context.png",

		},
		{
			"title":"Context Does Not Imply Intent",
			"img":"on-the-move.png",
			"text":"If we are always rushing somewhere when we're using our mobile devices, are we really only looking for a short, easily read, site? Could I be on the train trying to rebook my flight? Could I be in a car comparing menus at restaurants?"
		},
		{
			"title":"Rethink Context",
			"img":"couch-potato.png",
			"text":"Traffic studies shows that we are wrong about mobile context. Usage of mobile devices is not limited to when we are on the move. Mobile phones are used in front of the TV. Tablets are used to read in bed. Usage of these devices peaks when we're at home in the evenings."

		{
			"title":"An App For Each Device",
			"img":"an-app-per-device.png",

		},
		{
			"title":"Mobile Web",
			"img":"website-that-works.png",
			"text":"Do you <em>need</em> a mobile specific website. Are you sure about context and intent? Do you have the resources to experiment with multiple sites? Also what is mobile, should a tablet get the mobile site?"
		},
		{
			"title":"Don't Break the Web",
			"img":"mobile-broken.png",
			"text":"People love to share. Links to Instagram, blog entries, YouTube videos, links to your content. Make sure that it's available for mobile."
		},
		{
			"title":"One Website (to rule them all)",
			"img":"one-website.png",

		},
		{
			"title":"Focus on Content",
			"img":"content-first.png",
			"text":"Fill the screen with the content that the user came for. Do not fill it with menus. Find out why users are coming to your site, and put the most important reason front and center."
		},
		{
			"title":"Pay Attention",
			"img":"pay-attention.png",
			"text":"Even though people are not always in a rush when they're browsing their devices, they do not give their full attention. Improving your site by getting rid of fluff benefits desktop users as well."
		},
		{
			"title":"Natural User Interfaces",
			"img":"nui.png",
			"text":"Make use of touch features on mobile devices. Don't give the impression of touch responsiveness then forget to provide it. New gestures quickly become mainstream, make sure you're not breaking convention."
