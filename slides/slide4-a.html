	Jakob Nielson is <em>the</em> authority on usable web design. He's written numerous books about web design, and
	was one of the first to advocate so strongly for user driven design. To oversimplify, Jakob Nielsen suggests
	that users on mobile devices just don't have the time or the attention span for a lot of data. So give them
	minimal features and minimal data.
